## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Computer Engineer** diving deep into **Artificial Intelligence**, exploring how machines learn, reason, and understand language.

My focus spans **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Transformers, and Large Language Models**. I prioritize strong fundamentals, hands-on implementation, and understanding model internals rather than treating AI as a black box.

I work primarily in **Python**, experimenting with modern frameworks while continuously strengthening my theoretical foundations.
